                <p>This is El monumental and in Argentina according to <em><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1082896/like-soccer-argentina/"> 
                    STATISTA</a></em> in 2021 about 97% of the entire male population
                    were interested in soccer and about 70% women
                    in the entire country follow the sport. The world cup in Qatar brought and broke
                    the record of viewers in the country and thus making Argentina a country where
                    fans take it extremely seriously the love of the sport.

                <p>Bievenidos a La Bodega in the nation of tango and wine, not only Argentina is known for its soccer, music or wine
                    but its delicious fresh cattle and livestock in general. The quality is simply the best
                    exporting a lot of meat to neighbor countries and abroad. The Argentineans are very
                    patriotic when it comes about food and futbol. A nation that when the world cup happens every
                    4 years almost everyone stops working, litteraly. Visit Argentina, to witness my words.
