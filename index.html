        <p>Life in Argentina is enjoyed at its fullest by traveling around the country. Forests, metropolis, farms, even historic
        places in La Patagonia can all show everyone a little bit of the country and the life
        with everyone living in it. There are many places to visit and there are places for those
        looking to EAT and DANCE. Buenos Aires Argentina, has 2 main places ANYONE new to the country <em>MUST VISIT FIRST.</em>
        Nightlife in Argentina could get expensive so it would make sense to arrive with a budget and some options.
        Let go ahead and talk about 2 places specifically. El monumental represents Argentina's sacred sport, el futbol or soccer.
        The fans or colloquialy known for "Las barras bravas" are very well organized and be sure to see violence during el
        super clasico "The Classic rivalry". Ask any Argentinian who is the best soccer player in the world and expect to hear
        Lionel Messi or Diego Maradona. Futbol in Argentina is LIFE.

        The food in the country will definetly keep even the most strict critic coming back for more everyday. The way Argentinians cook meat is out of this world.
        from the gauchos cooking and cutting meat in front of you to the sound of sizzling steak, be sure to be hungry before
        attending la Bodega in Buenos Aires. Beef is simply un comparable to any other country in the world and by nature, the
        Argentinians are very proud about it.
